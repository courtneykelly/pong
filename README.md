## Libraries
There are several different libraries needed in order to compile and run our game. First, you need to be using any version of `python 2`. If you have a later version of python installed and cannot install additional modules to `python2` then we suggest creating a virtual environment. Here is a helpful [article](https://uoa-eresearch.github.io/eresearch-cookbook/recipe/2014/11/20/conda/) on how to do so. You will also need to install `pygame` and `twisted`. Those modules may have additional dependencies you need to install as well such as `mercial` or `zope.interface`. 

`twisted` can be installed using your favorite package manager (i.e., `anaconda` or `pip`), but `pygame` must be installed using `pip`. If you do not have `pip` installed, please install it. 

**Summary**
* must be run using `Python 2`
* Python modules
  * pygame
